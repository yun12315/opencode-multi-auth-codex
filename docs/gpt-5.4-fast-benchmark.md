# GPT-5.4 Fast Benchmark

This benchmark was run against OpenCode using the multi-auth Codex plugin in a real repository, with continued-session prompts that read files, analyze code, and reuse the same session across multiple turns.

## Summary Table

| Mode | Avg Time to First Text | Avg Time to Complete | Total Tokens/sec | Output Tokens/sec | Reasoning Tokens/sec | Completed Turns/min | Notes |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| GPT-5.4 Medium | 12.85s | 12.92s | 8,361 | 37.7 | 3.5 | 4.87 | Baseline |
| GPT-5.4 Medium Fast | 12.01s | 12.10s | 8,594 | 40.1 | 4.4 | 5.01 | 6.4% faster overall |
| GPT-5.4 High | 57.10s | 57.21s | 4,645 | 23.3 | 7.4 | 1.27 | Baseline |
| GPT-5.4 High Fast | 63.65s | 63.72s | 6,629 | 37.0 | 12.9 | 1.75 | Higher throughput, mixed latency |
| GPT-5.4 XHigh | 88.48s | 88.56s | 2,836 | 22.8 | 13.6 | 0.88 | Baseline |
| GPT-5.4 XHigh Fast | 69.45s | 69.55s | 3,540 | 32.5 | 20.0 | 1.10 | 21.5% faster overall |

## Headline Results

- `XHigh Fast` reduced end-to-end continued-session latency by `21.5%`.
- `XHigh Fast` increased throughput by:
  - `+24.8%` total tokens/sec
  - `+42.7%` output tokens/sec
  - `+47.2%` reasoning tokens/sec
- `Medium Fast` delivered a smaller but consistent `6.4%` latency improvement.
- `High Fast` improved throughput significantly, but did not produce stable latency gains.

## Methodology

- Same repository
- Same prompt sequence
- Same continued-session flow
- Real file reads and tool usage
- Metrics taken from live OpenCode runs

This benchmark is intended to capture realistic coding-session behavior, not cold-start single-turn chat latency.
