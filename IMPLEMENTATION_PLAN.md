# OpenCode Multi-Auth Reliability Upgrade Plan

## 1. Objective
Upgrade `guard22/opencode-multi-auth-codex` so it is reliable and low-maintenance for daily use, with strict pre-promotion validation.

Primary goal: multi-account Codex linking + rotation that just works.

## 1.1 Repository Location Requirement
- Repository location for implementation and tests:
  - `/Users/jorgitin/Documents/projects/open_multi_auth`

## 1.2 Baseline and Scope
- Baseline upstream: `https://github.com/guard22/opencode-multi-auth-codex`
- This work is a hardening/improvement pass on upstream plus custom behavior changes.
- Implement in source TypeScript (`src/*`), tests, and docs. Do not hand-edit `dist/*` for release.

## 1.3 Custom Changes Included
- Account-level re-auth from dashboard/API.
- Account-level iOS-like `Enabled` switch from dashboard/API.
- Remove legacy disable control; `Enabled` switch becomes the disable mechanism.
- Keep force toggle separate from account `Enabled` switch behavior and UI.

## 1.4 Known Live Issues to Permanently Fix
- Limits probe can fail from model/config incompatibility (for example `xhigh` with probe model).
- Failed probe runs may emit `token_count`; those must never overwrite authoritative limits.
- Weekly/five-hour values can look inconsistent if stale/error-derived snapshots are shown as fresh.

## 1.5 Permanent Limits Accuracy Requirements
- Dashboard/API limits must come from the last successful authoritative probe only.
- Failed/incomplete probe runs must not mutate stored `weekly`/`fiveHour` values.
- If latest probe fails, expose error + freshness/confidence state.
- If no successful snapshot exists yet, show `unknown` (never synthetic `0%`).

## 2. Independent Phase Execution Model (for multi-model implementation)
- Each phase below is an independent packet with its own markdown TODOs, verification, and handoff outputs.
- You can execute phases in separate model sessions and with different models.
- Recommended order is `A -> I`, but each phase can be completed and validated independently.
- A phase is considered complete only when its local verification checklist is green.
- If a phase changes shared contracts, rerun affected verification in prior completed phases.

## 3. Locked Decisions
- Core connector reliability is first priority.
- Dashboard is localhost-only (`127.0.0.1` / loopback); no remote dashboard mode.
- Weighted scheduler is opt-in (`weighted-round-robin`).
- Force mode pins one account for 24h and auto-reverts to previous strategy.
- Antigravity remains in codebase but is off by default and hidden unless explicitly enabled.
- Promotion policy: canary -> weighted enablement -> 72h stability watch.
- Rollback trigger: any critical reliability/security incident.

## 4. Shared Contracts (must remain valid across all phases)

## 4.1 Store Contract
- [ ] Store supports versioned schema (`v2`) with deterministic migration from `v1`.
- [ ] Per-account fields include: `enabled`, `disabledAt`, `disabledBy`, `disableReason` (optional).
- [ ] Limits fields include: `rateLimits`, `rateLimitHistory`, `limitStatus`, `limitError`, `lastLimitProbeAt`, `lastLimitErrorAt`.
- [ ] Force fields include: `forcedAlias`, `forcedUntil`, `previousRotationStrategy`, `forcedBy`.

## 4.2 API Contract
- [ ] Mutating endpoints return deterministic typed errors (`code`, `message`, optional `details`).
- [ ] Alias-scoped mutating endpoints must only mutate target alias.
- [ ] `GET /api/accounts` includes eligibility/health/cooldown + limits freshness/confidence metadata.

## 4.3 Limits Data Quality Contract
- [ ] Probe sets compatible reasoning effort explicitly (`low` default, env-overridable).
- [ ] Probe retries/fallback handles `unsupported_value` / `reasoning.effort` failures.
- [ ] Failed/incomplete probe sessions are non-authoritative and cannot overwrite limits.
- [ ] No-authoritative-data state is represented as `unknown`.

## 4.4 Observability Contract
- [ ] Decision logs include `requestId`, `strategy`, `selectedAlias`, `fallbackReason`, `forceState`, `enabledState`.
- [ ] Sensitive token material is redacted in all log paths.

- [ ] Update `docs/QA.md` troubleshooting matrix.
- [ ] Keep `TEST_EXECUTION_PLAN.md` current with scripts and gate order.
- [ ] Promotion steps:
  - [ ] capture baseline metrics
  - [ ] 24h canary on round-robin
  - [ ] weighted enablement
  - [ ] 72h stability watch
- [ ] Rollback drill:
  - [ ] revert to last known-good

  - [ ] verify `list/status/switch/refresh`

### Verification (Enhanced)
**L1: Documentation Completeness**
- [ ] Doc review: `README.md` includes simple install/use instructions
- [ ] Doc review: `README.md` includes quickstart example
- [ ] Doc review: `docs/TESTING.md` lists all exact test commands
- [ ] Doc review: `docs/TESTING.md` explains test execution order
- [ ] Doc review: `docs/OFFLINE_RECOVERY.md` covers store corruption recovery
- [ ] Doc review: `docs/OFFLINE_RECOVERY.md` covers auth file recovery
- [ ] Doc review: `docs/QA.md` includes troubleshooting matrix
- [ ] Doc review: `docs/QA.md` includes all test execution results
- [ ] Doc review: `TEST_EXECUTION_PLAN.md` matches actual test scripts

**L2: Script Availability Verification**
- [ ] Verify: `npm run lint` script exists and runs
- [ ] Verify: `npm run build` script exists and runs
- [ ] Verify: `npm run test:unit` script exists and runs
- [ ] Verify: `npm run test:integration` script exists and runs
- [ ] Verify: `npm run test:web:headless` script exists and runs
- [ ] Verify: `npm run test:failure` script exists and runs
- [ ] Verify: `npm run test:stress` script exists and runs
- [ ] Verify: `npm run test:sandbox` script exists and runs
- [ ] Verify: `npm run test:soak:48h` script exists and runs

**L3: Canary Testing**
- [ ] Canary: 24h canary test started on round-robin strategy
- [ ] Canary: Metrics captured (success rate, latency, rotation distribution)
- [ ] Canary: Weighted strategy enablement test
- [ ] Canary: 72h stability watch initiated
- [ ] Canary: No critical errors during canary period
- [ ] Canary: Performance regression < 10%

**L4: Rollback Drill**
- [ ] Rollback: Revert to last known-good version documented
- [ ] Rollback: Settings snapshot restore procedure tested
- [ ] Rollback: `list` command works after rollback
- [ ] Rollback: `status` command works after rollback
- [ ] Rollback: `switch` command works after rollback
- [ ] Rollback: `refresh` command works after rollback
- [ ] Rollback: Rollback completes within 5 minutes
- [ ] Rollback: Zero data loss during rollback

**L5: Acceptance Criteria Verification**
- [ ] Verify: Every required phase packet is complete (A-I)
- [ ] Verify: Shared contracts (Section 4) remain valid
- [ ] Verify: Full validation matrix (Phase H) is green
- [ ] Verify: Permanent limits accuracy requirements met
- [ ] Verify: Account lifecycle controls complete
- [ ] Verify: Promotion and rollback readiness complete

**L6: Final QA Evidence**
- [ ] Complete QA evidence collected in `docs/QA.md`
- [ ] All test execution logs archived
- [ ] All handoff outputs from phases A-I present
- [ ] Phase H: 5 consecutive integration runs all pass
- [ ] Phase H: 5 consecutive headless runs all pass
- [ ] Phase H: Stress test shows no lost updates
- [ ] Phase H: Soak test 48h completed successfully

**L7: Release Readiness**
- [ ] Security review complete (no exposed credentials)
- [ ] Performance SLOs met (Section 3.7)
- [ ] Rollback procedure documented and tested
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured
- [ ] Team trained on new features

### Handoff Output
- [ ] Release-readiness checklist signed off.
- [ ] Final QA evidence package in `docs/QA.md`.
- [ ] Test execution summary with all phases passing.
- [ ] Rollback procedure documented.
- [ ] Promotion metrics documented.

## 6. Cross-Phase Handoff Template (use at end of every phase)
- [ ] Phase ID + date/time
- [ ] Files changed
- [ ] Commands run + pass/fail
- [ ] Known limitations/deferred items
- [ ] Risks introduced (if any)
- [ ] Next-phase recommendations

## 7. Final Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Every required phase packet is complete.
- [ ] Shared contracts (Section 4) remain valid.
- [ ] Full validation matrix (Phase H) is green.
- [ ] Permanent limits accuracy requirements are met (`unknown` + failed-probe-safe behavior).
- [ ] Account lifecycle controls are complete (`Enabled` switch replaces legacy disable; force remains separate).
- [ ] Promotion and rollback readiness complete.
